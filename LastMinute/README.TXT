The application uses memory to store the data. A database and a framework like hibernate 
should be used but I use memory for simplicity as the scope, aim and developing time
 of the exercise is unknown.

JSON objects are used but java objects should be used and an adapter and a library like gson too. But, again, we use JSON objects
 for simplicity as the scope, aim and developing time of the exercise is unknown.
 
 In the payments service a an array is returned inside a json object but the array has no name. I suppose this is an error
  so I put a name to the array.
